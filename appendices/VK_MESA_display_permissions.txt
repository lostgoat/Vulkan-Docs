For DRM based driver stacks, a direct mode display acquisition operation will
provide the caller with elevated privileges. The caller may then wish to create
a VkDevice using these elevated privileges.

This extension provides a mechanism for the caller to specify that a
vkCreateDevice operation should inherit the privileges associated with a
VkDisplayKHR object.

When vkCreateDevice is called, if a sname:VkDeviceInheritDisplayPermissionsMESA
structure is present in the pNext chain, then the device will inherit the
privileges associated with the VkDisplayKHR object specified in
sname:VkDeviceInheritDisplayPermissionsMESA::pname:display.

TODO: document restrictions, e.g.:
  * No memory allocations between display acquire and device creation
